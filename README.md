## Description

Allows FAMU students and/or faculty to track the venom accurately and in real time based on their
current location.

## App Evaluation

- **Category:** Navigation
- **Story:** Tracker follows the location of the venom shuttles in real-time (i.e. when a venom 
shuttle moves, the location of that specific shuttle updates on the map and also moves). Users
can favorite certain stops, arrival and departure times, and destinations.
- **Market:** Any and all members of the FAMU community that need to maneuver the campus.
- **Habit:** This app could be used up to 7 days a week, especially on the weekend (Saturday and
Sunday) by on-campus students as the venom is not as reliable and predictable.
- **Scope:** First the app will have to be tested and optimized for FAMU campus. The app could 
possibly be integrated with the FAMU mobile app so that an additional app won't need to be
downloaded by users. Larger potential for the app would be to incorporate other campuses throughout
Florida and then throughout the country.
